Author's note:
I've done this collection Life in a few days, a puzzle after another, between November and December 2015. My purpose in this collection was to offer a repertoire of typical Sokoban problems. There are some difficult puzzles, others are easier, all mixed, and there are two hard levels (#34 and #52): If you can't solve them, leave them. Experience is important in Sokoban, and the puzzle that seems impossible to solve today may be solved in a while.

I have built this collection for peace in the world, and most especially to Syria, where there never had to be a war!

The best puzzles are: 10, 20, 37, 40, 41, 43, 44, 49, 58, 60, 62, 63, 65, 66-70.

I dedicate Life to the friend Laizhufu, author of incredible and imaginative puzzles.

Life is one of my favorite collections. I hope you like it.
